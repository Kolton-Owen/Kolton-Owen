Hello there, I am Kolton Owen! I am passionate about safety and security and have worked in professions that prove that, between the military and community corrections my life's work has been to defend those around me. I now am pivoting my desire for defense into the cybersecurity world through studies at SANS Technology Institute as well as home labs. 

### Objective
My journey in cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion for the defensive side of things. I am now eager to transition from the theoretical, labs portion of my learning to the real-world side of the career field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
